BLAM! v 0.0.3

	. Added ability to configure beautify seperately - modify beauty.cfg.js
	  for options, or use -b FILENAME
	. We now have "the good parts" jsLint config file, which can optionally
	  be added to each file, if it doesn't already have one, add -c to use.
	  Note: We use the good parts by default, update lint.default.cfg.js if
	  you need other things, or use -l FILENAME for different file

BLAM! v 0.0.2

	. Changed to spidermonkey JS engine (Java + Rhino = Sloooow). Note: YUI
	  Minify / Compress still requires Java
	. Added ability to run NaturalDocs as part of the process
	. Changed error output to the following format:

		[LINE]:[CHARACTER] [REASON] - [EVIDENCE]

	. We now supress whitespace related error messages, so you can 
	  concentrate on the real issues - this is fine, assuming you use BLAM!
	  of course

BLAM! v 0.0.1

	. BLAM = Beautify Lint And Minify
	. Allows you to Lint without worrying about whitespace (tm)
	. Intended usage is to always BLAM! before checking a file into the 
	  repository, or ideally run as a SVN commit hook
	. Runs on windows and OSX
	. First (closed alpha, ie: Jon.B and David.L testing) release
